  "articleText":"When you confront someone with how you're feeling, keeping up a barrier that limits what you would like to say can give someone else mixed signals and hinder them from understanding what it is that you're trying to communicate. \n\nOf course, there are some things that are better left unsaid, but it IS important that when you do attempt to talk about your emotions with someone, try to be transparent. It can be scary to do so but If you want something to come out of the conversation, both you and the other person would benefit from being on the same page. If someone hurt you with a comment they made, telling them how it made you feel is important even if it might seem embarrassing to let someone know your feelings are hurt. \n\nAlso, being transparent about your emotions go a lot farther than simply giving someone the silent treatment or trying to play off your bad mood awkwardly. Allowing yourself to be open and honest about how you feel can seem uncomfortable at first but doing this can help the other person understand your boundaries and mitigate further problems. One uncomfortable experience can be worth it if it means a level of understanding between you and someone else"
