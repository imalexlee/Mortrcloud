  "articleText":"So now that you've gotten a few ideas on how to put your feelings out there, it's time to learn how to turn those emotions into action. Before we look into how to ask for what you want and need from someone, it's important to discuss what shouldn't be said.\n\nFirst, in conjunction with the lesson about not telling someone that they're doing something wrong if your feelings are hurt, it's important to not ask someone to do something that seems like fixing a previous bad behavior. For instance, if someone made a joke that they didn't know upset you, don't phrase your want as \"Can you not make that rude joke anymore?\".\n\nWhile it certainly gets the point across that you don't want the joke to be made, it also makes the other person seem like they were being rude in the first place when simply they might not have known the joke would affect you.\n\nIn general, adding descriptors to instances like \"rude\", \"hurtful\", or \"thoughtless\" can make an event seem more intentional and malicious then it might be and this might cause the person receiving the unfair criticism to become defensive or closed off."
