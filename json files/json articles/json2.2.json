  "articleText":"Now that we've looked at how not to ask for someone to do something you want, it's now time to look at what you can say. For starters, understand that what you want needs to be something clear for the other person to do. Giving hints to what you want isn't going to help. Remember that this part of communication is supposed to turn your subjective emotions into an objective solution. \n\nLet's look at an example. Your S.O and you move in together and you realize that they're allergic to taking out the trash for some reason. You first start by putting forth your feelings, possibly like \"I feel used at times when only I take out the trash since we both use the trashcan\". This is a great start but can you see how this doesn't necessarily tell the other person what you want? Sure it implies it but it's very important to outline a clear and objective desire. \n\nWhen both parties agree to this, it makes it easier to act on it. So to do this, you would next ask them something like \"Can we please alternate who takes out the trash each time?\". So you can see these two parts working together that works to express a feeling, and proposes a solution without a screaming match about who is lazier in the relationship."
