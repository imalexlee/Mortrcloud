  "articleText":"The first step in becoming a better listener seems pretty obvious but countless people struggle with it. Cutting others off when they speak can halt a conversation and make the other person pull away from trying to speak to you again.\n\nIt is especially important to let others finish what they're saying if the subject matter is about their negative emotions, like opening up about their depression, negative self image, or even their bad day. Even if someone is talking about something funny they saw, or what they ate for dinner, interruptions can be very frustrating and turn a pleasant conversation into awkward silence.\n\nIf you are upset with someone, interrupting before they can fully explain their side of the situation can lead to avoidable misunderstandings and raise tensions. In situations like this, cutting someone off can also make them less likely to listen to you as well since most people would be less inclined to respect what you’re saying if you can’t do the same for them. In accordance with the ever-present Golden Rule, if you feel like being cut off would annoy you, then try not to do it to others.\n\nYour silence can go a long way for someone who simply wants to be listened to."
