  "articleText": "Another dimension to understanding the intention of other people is to try and understand where your judgment of the situation lies. If you get really mad at someone for something they said or did, ask yourself whether you are judging the other person fairly. \n\nThis differs from understanding the others' intention since you can see why they might be acting a certain way but still feel strong in some negative judgements about the other person. This aspect of understanding and working on your personal view of the situation can help turn a possible screaming match into a pleasant and productive conversation. Being able to separate your negative judgments from a situation allow for a clearer headspace where you can respond to the other person with a maintained calm and understanding tone. \n\nWhile it can be hard and near impossible sometimes to not get up in arms when you feel like someone says something rude to you, it's important to at least try and look for how your judgements might not 100% represent the situation for both people."
