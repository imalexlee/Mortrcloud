  "articleText":"Many people get embarrassed to bring up how they feel, think it isn't worth it, or they simply think they're upset for nothing. Thats why it's important that before you learn how to put forth your own feelings and emotions, that you truly believe that the way you feel about a situation is valid.\n\nA situation doesn't have to be objectively wrong for you to be upset about it. Someone might say something they didn't know upset you, or a friend might forget to call you. These things might not be objectively bad but still, if it makes you feel a certain emotion, then it still counts.\n\nOf course, just because you feel upset, it doesn't give you a free pass to get mad at everyone (which we get into later in this course), but understanding that the way you feel isn't simply a waste of energy is a great mindset to have when developing your ability to express yourself and understand others more effectively."
