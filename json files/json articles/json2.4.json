  "articleText":"Theres one more major piece to understand and keep in your mind when you are requesting something from someone else. Having a reasonable request is important as it makes sure the request can actually be accomplished. \n\nFor example, if you get upset that your partner has to travel for work a lot, you can't ask them to just stay home instead. Would this solution make you feel better? Yes. is it doable? technically yes. Is it reasonable? No. You cannot expect someone to do something that would hurt them in any way in order to accommodate your request. And if you're on the receiving end of an unreasonable request, be sure to not flat out agree to doing it either. \n\nAgreeing to accommodate to a request that you simply cannot fulfill is sure to let the other person down, make you seem like you wen't back on your promise, and probably give you a headache from trying to accommodate to it in the first place. As well as being very clear, a request that is reasonable for everyone involved can really help a problem subside."
