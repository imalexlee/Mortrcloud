  "articleText":"So you're talking to someone... you haven't interrupted so far which is good but now it's your turn to respond. There are a million different things you could say but please make sure it's on topic. If someone just told you how heartbroken they are because their favorite character in a movie died, don't immediately bring up the taco place across the street. \n\nChanging the subject abruptly can really make someone feel like you couldn't care less about what they're saying. No matter how light the topic is, if someone is interested in speaking to you about it, it can be a real let down if you hop to the next subject without adequately responding to what they just said to you. If you really have something you want to say that's off topic, make sure to respond to what they said first to let them know that you were listening before talking about what you want to talk about. \n\nIf the other person feels like you actually listened to them, they will probably be more likely to do the same for you. If you happened to zone out while they were talking, instead of saying \"That's crazy\" or \"Oh wow\" politely asking them to catch you up on what they said is fine and allows you to give a much more sincere response."
