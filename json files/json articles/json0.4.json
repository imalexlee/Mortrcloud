  "articleText":"When someone is bringing up an experience they've had, it can be very tempting to start talking about your own similar experience. This is fine, but if you are always switching the conversation from them to you, it can cause frustration and make you seem self centered. \n\nApart from making you look bad, it can be disappointing for someone who wanted to tell you something they experienced to get your thoughts and reactions on it, to be met with only your stories. Many times, bringing up our own experiences can help connect us with the other person like if you've both struggled with a certain class or both lived in a certain city. The way you present your side is what can help build a connection or taint a conversation. \n\nBuilding off the last lesson, you want to make sure you still adequately respond to what the other person has said before talking about yourself. Make it clear that you were in fact listening and cared about what they said before you go on to bring up your own story to build a better connection."
