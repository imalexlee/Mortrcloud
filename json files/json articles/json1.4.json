  "articleText":"Observe the difference between these two statements: \"I feel sad because I was hoping to spend time with you and disappointed that you cancelled\" and \"You knew how much hanging out meant to me but you cancelled instead\". Both statements address the other person cancelling and portray the speaker as being upset by it, but why is the first statement more productive? \n\nMaking someone feel like they did something bad usually does two things. First, it can make someone want to close off from possible shame they might feel. Think of how you would feel if your mom scolded you. Second, the person can get defensive because they don't want to feel like they did something bad. Either way, coming out the gate by making someone feel like they did something they weren't supposed to do can hurt a conversation. \n\nInstead, speaking ONLY on your emotions can minimize this reaction in the other person while expressing how you feel just as well. This is especially helpful when something upsets you that isn't objectively bad. For example, if your friends hang out without you, getting mad at them for hanging out would lead no where because they didn't technically do anything wrong. Instead, telling them how it hurt you can help you and your friends have a more productive discussion about the situation."
