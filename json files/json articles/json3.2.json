  "articleText":"Understanding the intention behind what someone says or does to you can be challenging, considering that if someone hurts us, we usually get mad at them. Someone who is feeling hurt by someones action might decide to scold them for what they did, when the other person might not have done anything objectively wrong. \n\nThis is an example of misunderstood intention and misplaced judgement. This ties in with taking things personally; it doesn't mean we shouldn't feel upset, but understanding that most things aren't meant to be a personal attack is a good place to start when trying to gauge a situation. Even when someone takes something out on you and might say something personal, try to think where that negativity came from. \n\nDid the other person get yelled at by their boss, fail a test, or almost get into a car accident?  While no one should take their anger out on an undeserving person, it happens, and it can be helpful for you to try your best to understand where the intention lies, and not only the dimension you can initially see."
