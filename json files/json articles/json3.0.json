When trying to understand your emotions, you might find that you feel a certain way because it might seem that you're on the receiving end of a deliberate attack on your emotions.\n\nTo explain what I mean, think of how common it is for someone to do something that might upset you, and how your mind can easily jump to \"why did they do that to me\" or \"Didn't they know how hurtful that was to me?\". These thoughts are valid but they might not portray the situation accurately. The other person probably isn't trying to hurt you intentionally, and it is helpful to try and attribute the negative event to a different cause then them being malicious.\n\nFor instance, if your friend forgot that it's your birthday, it's easy to think that they don't care about you that much and don't put value into one of your most special days. This friend however, might be dealing with a bad day or even a really good day and was too focused on either.\n\nEveryone makes mistakes and while they can upset us, it's important that we understand that most of those around us wouldn't actively try to hurt us for their personal enjoyment."
